      <p>
  As with the system models, the various noise models also come in different versions.
  You can build these noise models individually and inspect their responses. Let's look at a couple of examples.
</p>
<h2>Capacitive actuation Noise Model</h2>
<p>
  For example, let's build the noise model used for generating force and torque noise of the 
  GRS actuation. The model is called <tt>DIST_CAPACT</tt>.
  <br>
  We start by inspecting the model to see what versions are available, and, within each version, 
  the parameters available for setting. Start with opening the model documentation:
    <div class="fragment"><pre>
      help ssm_model_DIST_CAPACT</pre></div>
  and click on the 'Model Information' link.
  As we can see, there are 5 versions available. All of them allow the user to choose a parameter for the dimension 
  of the model, so to operate only along x (1D), along  x, y and phi (2D), or along all degrees of freedom (3D).
  In addition, you can scroll to the 
  details section for a particular model version and see what configuration parameters
  are available to you. For instance, in this case we have different pole-zero models that characterize the noise shaping filters
  that color unit-variance white noise to mimick the force and torque noise associated with the electrostatic
  actuation provided bt the GRS and the FEE.
  
  After deciding the version we want to build, and the values of the parameters we want to set, we can build
  it by doing:
  <div class="fragment"><pre>
      <span class="comment">% Build the default version of the GRS CAPactive ACTuation noise model</span>      
      GRScapactNoise = ssm(plist(<span class="string">'built-in'</span>, <span class="string">'DIST_CAPACT'</span>));</pre></div>
  Now that we've built the object, we can use the <tt>ssm/viewDetails</tt> method to inspect the various inputs and outputs of this model:
  <div class="fragment"><pre>
      GRScapactNoise.viewDetails</pre></div>  
  so to understand how the input blocks are called, how many and which ports we have for each input, and how many and which outputs are available.
</p>

<h2>IFO readout Noise Models</h2>
<p>
  As another example, let's build the noise model used for generating readout noise of the 
  interferometer. The model is called <tt>DIST_IFO_READOUT</tt>.
  <br>
  Again, start by inspecting the model to see what versions are available, and, within each version, 
  the parameters available for setting. As before, open the model documentation with:
    <div class="fragment"><pre>
      help ssm_model_DIST_IFO_READOUT</pre></div>
  As we can see, there are 4 versions available. All of them allow the user to choose a parameter for the dimensions 
  of the model, so to operate only with the longitudinal degrees of freedom (1D), or also with angular ones (2D and 3D).
  In addition, you can scroll to the 
  details section for a particular model version and see what configuration parameters
  are available to you. For instance, in this case we have different pole-zero models that characterize the noise shaping filters
  that color unit-variance white noise to mimick the readout noise for the different IFO components.
  
  After deciding the version we want to build, and the values of the parameters we want to set, we can build
  it by doing:
  <div class="fragment"><pre>
      <span class="comment">% Build the default version of the IFO Readout noise model</span>      
      IFOreadoutNoise = ssm(plist(<span class="string">'built-in'</span>, <span class="string">'DIST_IFO_READOUT'</span>));</pre></div>
  Now that we built the object, we can use the <tt>ssm/viewDetails</tt> method to inspect the various inputs and outputs of this model:
  <div class="fragment"><pre>
      IFOreadoutNoise.viewDetails</pre></div>  
  so to understand how the input blocks are called, how many and which ports we have for each input, and how many and which outputs are available. 
</p>
<p>
This noise source is added after the modelling of the actual conversion of the TMs position into an IFO reading, 
so it represents noise sources such as shot noise in the beams, electronics noise (additive, digitization, ...).
</p>
<p>
Other noise sources that act 'common mode' on all IFO channels, such as 
laser frequency fluctuations, are modelled by the <tt>DIST_IFO_POSITION</tt> noise model, that can be built by doing:
 <div class="fragment"><pre>
      <span class="comment">% Build the default version of the IFO so-called position noise model</span>      
      IFOfrequencyNoise = ssm(plist(<span class="string">'built-in'</span>, <span class="string">'DIST_IFO_POSITION'</span>));</pre></div>
  Now that we built the object, we can use the <tt>ssm/viewDetails</tt> method to inspect the various inputs and outputs of this model:
  <div class="fragment"><pre>
      IFOfrequencyNoise.viewDetails</pre></div>  
  so to understand how the input blocks are called, how many and which ports we have for each input, and how many and which outputs are available. 
</p>
