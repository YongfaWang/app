      <H2>What is a ssm object?</H2>
<P>The <tt>ssm</tt> class is a class to use &ldquo;state space models&rdquo;
for simulation, identification and modeling in the LTPDA toolbox. A state
space model is a mathematical object constituted of</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>A time model represented by the field &ldquo;timestep&rdquo;,
	either discrete or continuous (&ldquo;timestep&rdquo; is then 0)</P>
	<LI><P>A linear differential equation, which turns into a difference
	equation it the model is time discrete. This equation is written
	using a state space x in the form x' = Ax + Bu where A is the state
	transition matrix and B the state input matrix, u being the
	exogenous input signal. In this setup, x and u are time series.</P>
	<LI><P>An observation equation which allows for linear observation
	of the input and the state : y = Cx+Du. The variable y is the output
	of the system.</P>
</UL>
<P>Input and output variables (lines in u and y) may be named and
assigned a unit. However for the state x there is more of a choice
since if free of choice via a basis change. The most usual choice is
that x contents the same units as y and it derivatives, or the same
units as u and its integrals. In general the size of the state space
is equal to the number of poles in the system.</P>
<P>In the LTPDA toolbox, lines in u,y,x are grouped in blocks (input
blocks, state blocks, output blocks) to ease the understanding of a
large system. This means the matrices A, B, C, and D are also split
into blocks of the corresponding size. The diagonal blocks of A may
represent the dynamics of a LTP subsystem (the controller, the
propulsion &hellip;) or the coupling between two systems (from the
propulsion to the equations of motion)... In addition the dynamic
equation also contains an inertia matrix M so that the parametric
equation is made simple. The equation becomes M x' = Ax + Bu. If not
user set M is supposed to be the identity.</P>
<P>Below we build a standard system to show the contents of the
object.</P>

The fields &ldquo;amats&rdquo;, &ldquo;mmats&rdquo;, &ldquo;bmats&rdquo;,
&ldquo;cmats&rdquo;, &ldquo;dmats&rdquo; contain the matrices of the
differential and observation equation of a mass spring system with
dampening.</P>
<P>The systems inputs/states/outputs are listed by blocks. There are
two input blocks, which correspond to the commanded signal (COMMAND) and
the noise (NOISE). There is one state block and one output block. Each
input has its name displayed followed with individual input variable
names and units. Note that the empty ssm object does not have an
input block, a state block and an output block of size 0, it has no
such blocks, and the size fields are empty.</P>
<P>The &ldquo;params&rdquo; field is the 1x1 default plist with the symbolic
parameters. In the case when the system is fully numerical,
parameters are deleted from the field &ldquo;params&rdquo; as they
get substituted. Viceversa, when the model is not fully numeric (as in this case), the &ldquo;params&rdquo; plist is filled with the names of
the symbolic parameters.</P>
<P>Inputs, states and output sizes are summed up in the fields N* and
*sizes.</P>
<p>Useful informations about the structure and the content of the <tt>ssm</tt> built-in models can be obtained by 
accessing their dynamics documentation. In order to access these information, just remember that all <tt>ssm</tt> 
model files are called <tt>ssm_model_&lt;model_name&gt;</tt> and then type</p>

 <p>The 'Model Information' link is very useful since it will open a help browser html page like the following:</p>

<p>In this way you can know the structure of the model, in terms of the building blocks, the input and output ports and so on.</p>
