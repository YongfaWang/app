<h3>Selecting the objects to submit</h3>
<p>
  The tree structure in the upper left part of the window lists all the LTPDA objects available for submission currently in the MATLAB workspace (at loading it may be necessary to double click the root item, 'Workspace', to open up the tree). The user can<tt> ctrl-click</tt> to 
  select a subset of objects in the tree for submission. Clicking
  the 'Refresh' button will reload the entire tree, based upon the objects in MATLAB workspace, while the 'Select' button will add the selected objects to the list to submit, displayed beneath the tree.<br />
  If the user knows the name of all the objects we wants to submit, as a shortcut it's possible to directly write the variable names in the 'Objects to submit' list field: all the names written must correspond to a proper LTPDA object currently in MATLAB workspace.</p>
<h3>Completing the submission form</h3>
<p>
  In order to ease subsequent usage of data submitted, and to allow for high level queries to be performed,
  the submission process must be completed with additional and sensitive informations associated 
  with the data included in the objects.
  The first three fields, marked in red, are mandatory (a submssion without specifying those informations 
  will fail). The availble fields are:
   <ul>
	<li> <tt>Experiment title</tt> A short title for the experiment from which the data originate. 
    Mandatory field, to be filled with more that 4 characters.</li>
	<li> <tt>Experiment description</tt> A description of the experiment from which the data originate.
	Mandatory field, to be filled with more that 10 characters.</li>
	<li> <tt>Analysis description</tt> A description of the analysis performed on the data.
	Mandatory field, to be filled with more that 10 characters.</li>
    <li> <tt>Quantity</tt> The physical quantity that the data represent.</li>
    <li> <tt>Keywords</tt> A comma-delimited list of keywords.</li>
    <li> <tt>Reference IDs</tt> A list od object IDs that are relevant to this/these results.</li>
    <li> <tt>Additional Comments</tt> Anything else the user wants to say about the objects being submitted.</li>
    <li> <tt>Additional Authors</tt> A list of people who helped creating these object(s)</li>
   </ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>
After inserting the useful information by filling the corresponding entries, the user can proceed with
the submission by clicking the 'Submit' button. The status bar, in the lower part of the window, will show the response from the repository,
including the IDs assigned to the submitted objects.</p>
