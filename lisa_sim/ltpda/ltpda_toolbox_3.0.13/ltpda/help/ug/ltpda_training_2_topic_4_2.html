      <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Building signals in LTPDA can be done in various ways. Perhaps you already have data
  in a text file, or you have a formula for a particular time-series. These can all be
  accommodated by the AO constructor.
</p>
<p>
  Another useful way to build template signals is by using so-called 'built-in models'. These
  built-in models serve as kind-of user-defined constructors. They typicall output objects of a
  particular type, with the exact details of the object being governed by a few configuration
  parameters. For example, you've already used a built-in model to build a particular kind of 
  <tt>ssm</tt> object -- the LPF model. We also have built-in models for some of the signal templates
  indended for use in some of the LPF system identification experiments.
</p>
<p>
  If you launch the LTPDA model browser, you can browse the various built-in models available to 
  LTPDA on your system. To launch the browser, do:
  <div class="fragment"><pre>
  >> LTPDAModelBrowser    
  </pre></div>
  You can also request a textual list of the available models for a particular LTPDA user class by
  doing, for example, 
  <div class="fragment"><pre>
  >> ao.getBuiltInModels
  </pre></div>
</p>
<h2>Building signals from AO built-in model</h2>
<p>
  The battery of signals prescribed in S2-UTN-TN-3045 for the first system identification
  experiment can be built using the following command:
  <div class="fragment"><pre>
  >> sig = ao(plist(<span class="string">'built-in'</span>, <span class="string">'signals_3045_1_1'</span>));
  </pre></div>
  If you plot this AO you should see a plot like this:
  <div align="center">
    <IMG src="images/ltpda_training_2/Topic4/ao_model_signals_3045_1_1_output.png"  align="center" border="0">
  </div>
  There are a number of ao built-in models included in the LPF_DA_Module which reproduce
  the signals for the TN-3045 experiments. All 6 of these models have a single configurable parameter. 
  To see the help/description for this model, either use the model browser, or from the terminal do:
  <div class="fragment"><pre>
  >> help ao_model_signals_3045_1_1
  </pre></div>
  This pattern is always the same in LTPDA, to get help for any built-in model, you need to know
  its class, then just do:
  <div class="fragment"><pre>
  >> help [class]_model_[model name]
  </pre></div>
  The help usually includes a short description of the model and a link called "Model Information". If
  you click on that you will see a window which gives more information about the model and the parameters
  you can configure at build-time. For example, for the model we built above, you can also specify
  the gap you want to have between each of the 7 finite duration sine-waves. The duration of the 
  sine-waves is specified by the experiment and so is not a parameter. To change the gap between all signals to 1000s, 
  build the model like this:
  <div class="fragment"><pre>
  >> sig = ao(plist(<span class="string">'built-in'</span>, <span class="string">'signals_3045_1_1'</span>, <span class="string">'gaps'</span>, 1000));
  </pre></div>
