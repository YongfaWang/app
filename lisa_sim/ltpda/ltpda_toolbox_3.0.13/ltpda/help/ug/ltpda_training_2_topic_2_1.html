      <h2>Introducing state-space models in LTPDA</h2>
<p>
  State-space models in LTPDA are encapsulated by the <tt>ssm</tt> class. Building 
  state-space models by hand, while possible, is complicated and beyond the scope
  of this training session. The most useful class constructor we can use for building
  <tt>ssm</tt> objects is the one that builds from built-in models.
</p>
<p>
  For the purposes of this training session, we can treat the resulting state-space
  models as black boxes. They have inputs and outputs and describe a system in terms
  of a state-space realisation of the system's dynamical response. More details about
  the implementation is provided in the main LTPDA user manual.
</p>
<p>
  State-space model objects in LTPDA are structured in the following way. Each model
  has a number of
  <ul>
  <li>input blocks</li> 
  <li>state blocks</li>
  <li>output blocks.</li></ul> 
  Each block has a number of ports. The exact numbers of blocks and ports depends on 
  the underlying state-space structure of the system, but they need to properly match in order to
  allow the model to be consistent. The structure of a model is shown 
  in the following figure:

</p>

<h2>Building a state-space model in LTPDA</h2>
<p>
  LTPDA comes with some example built-in models for the <tt>ssm</tt> class. One such
  example is a simple 1D harmonic oscillator. To build this model we use the 'built-in' 
  model constructor of the <tt>ssm</tt> class. (Note: the 'built-in' model constructor can be 
  used for all the different user classes in LTPDA.)
</p>
<p>
  To see a list of the <tt>ssm</tt> built-in models available to you, you can do
  <div class="fragment"><pre>
  <span class="comment">% Get a list of available built-in ssm models</span>
  ssm.getBuiltInModels</pre></div>
<br>
  Or you can use the graphical interface for browsing models:
  <div class="fragment"><pre>
  <span class="comment">% Use the model browser</span>
  LTPDAModelBrowser</pre></div>
<br>
  To build one of these models, for example, the 1D Harmonic Oscillator, you can do:
  <div class="fragment"><pre>
  <span class="comment">% Build a Harmonic Oscillator model</span>
  sys = ssm(plist(<span class="string">'built-in'</span>, <span class="string">'HARMONIC_OSC_1D'</span>))</pre></div>
<br>
  You should then see details of the model on the terminal. To get a nicer view of the
  inputs and outputs for this model, you can do:
  <div class="fragment"><pre>
  <span class="comment">% View details of the model</span>
  sys.viewDetails</pre></div>
<br>
  You should then see a window like the following:
  <div align="center">
    <IMG src="images/ltpda_training_2/Topic2/harm_osc_details.png" width="600" align="center" border="0">
  </div>
  This should show details about the different blocks (inputs, states, outputs) and then the
  ports within those blocks. 
<br>  
  In this case, the system has two input blocks, called ''command'' and ''noise'', that can be used to respectively
  the external force acting on the particle, and the additive noise of the readout observing the position of the particle itself.
  Each input block has a name, a description, and (in this case) only one port. Each port has an index, a name, a description, and some 
  physical units for the quantity in input.
  The system has one state block, with two states (position and velocity of the particle). Each state has an index, a name, a description, and some 
  physical units for the quantity it represents.
  In this case, the system has one output block, called ''position'', that represents the particle position as observed via the readout 
  (meaning, with the readout noise added). The output block has a name, a description, and (in this case) only one port. Each port has an index, a name, a description, and some 
  physical units for the quantity in output.
<br>
  Additionally, the report includes a description of the parameters, if any, 
  that can be adjusted to characterize the system, and are represented in symbolic or numeric form.
</p>

<h2>Assembling state-space models in LTPDA</h2>
<p>
  If you build multiple <tt>ssm</tt> objects, you can assemble them together using the <tt>ssm/assemble</tt> 
  method. Although we don't need to do that in this training session, it may be useful to know
  the rules in case you want to build your own models, and because the LPF models we will be using are built in this way, assembling simpler subsystems. 
  Essentially, if you ask LTPDA to assemble
  2 or more models, then it will look for matching input and output blocks and connect them together.
  Here, matching means that the input block <em>name</em> matches the output block name, and that they 
  both have the same <em>number of ports</em>. The ports are then connected in numerical order. The inputs
  of any block which gets connected to an output block will not appear in the final composite model.
</p>

<h2>Using state-space models in LTPDA</h2>
<p>
  Once you have built your <tt>ssm</tt> model in LTPDA, you can go on and use 
  it in various ways. The most common ways are to produce transfer functions (using <tt>ssm/bode</tt>) 
  responses of the system or to simulate the time-domain system response to different inputs (using <tt>ssm/simulate</tt>).
  Both of these topics will be covered in later sections.
