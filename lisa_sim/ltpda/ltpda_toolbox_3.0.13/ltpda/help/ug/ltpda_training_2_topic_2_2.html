      <h2>LTP System Models</h2>
<p>
  Let's start with a word on terminology. The current implementation of the LPF models in LTPDA
  uses: <ul> 
  <li>the term 'LTP' to refer to the entire system but without noise models</li>
  <li>the term 'LPF' to refer to 'LTP' + noise models</li></ul> 
  All of the LPF <tt>ssm</tt> models are provided by the <tt>LPF_DA_Module</tt> LTPDA extension module.
</p>
<p>
  The 3D closed-loop dynamical system of LTP is modelled using a number of sub-models
  which are then assembled together to produce the final LTP model. The following
  diagram shows the full set of <tt>ssm</tt> models which are assembled together
  to give the main composite model 'LPF'.
  <br>

  <br>
  All noise models begin with the prefix <tt>DIST_*</tt>, and they are inputs to the corresponding model.
  The noise models typically have one output block, whose name is the same as the model itself.
  <br>
  Each submodel has many 
  parameters which all have default values. In section 7 you will learn how to 
  change these parameter values at both build time and run time. 
</p>
<p>
  As well as having many parameters, each sub-model has many inputs and outputs. In the process of
  assembling the full LTP (or LPF) model, some of the inputs disappear (because they
  are connected to outputs). However, many do not. 
</p>
<p>  
  The following diagram shows the full
  LTP model indicating many of the inputs and outputs you have access to.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  Any input named <tt>DIST_*</tt> will not appear in the full LPF model because the various
  noise models will connect to these. However, the noise models themselves also have inputs
  where you can inject noise/signals. These are described below.
</p>
<h2>LPF Noise Models</h2>
<p>
  The LTP model (and its submodels) have many inputs labelled <tt>DIST_*</tt>. These inputs are 
  designed for inputting noise. The output block has two ports, one named <tt>*_DC</tt> for the DC term, 
  and one named <tt>*_NOISE</tt> for the fluctuating term. 
  To simplify this process, we have created a set of noise models
  (noise shaping filters) which, when you input unit variance white noise, inject a particular
  coloured noise into the LTP model. The first figure above shows the various noise models.
